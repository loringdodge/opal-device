DEV NOTES


location-based search (on-demand; fast performance is critical):

CURRENT:
search for any placename.
displays ~20 photos, sorted into "happy" and "sad"
displays a single data point on the graph (% of posts that are happy)

sometimes there are errors during search and the view doesnt change
console error for invalid placename "cannot read property geometry of undefined"
sad photos take way longer to load


DESIRED:

search for any placename
  ...large dataset is retrieved
  happiness % is rendered on correct spot on the big map
representative photos are displayed somehow (and sorted into happy / sad)
improve runtime


top cities search (expensive operation. occasional cron job)

CURRENT:

 - not implemented - 


DESIRED:

batch search for set of 30 - 50 cities. for each city, conduct search described above.
cache all data to Mongo DB.
populate map view with all the data.








QUESTIONS:

how is location field parsed? what are valid and invalid inputs?
 - currently it's cityname. spaces are escaped (with '%20' characters)




 BUGFIXES:
sometimes there are errors during search and the view doesnt change
console error for invalid placename "cannot read property geometry of undefined"
runs a search immediately upon visiting locationView (redoes old search, or default search? unclear)


REFACTOR:

user.js and location.js controllers share a lot of duplicate logic.
replace twinword api with open-source sentiment repo.



MISC NOTES:


$scope on LOCATION view has these main properties:

.images: object containing 2 arrays, "positive" and "negative", each of which contain little tuples representing unique photos.
  { "negative": [ [image url, instagram href], [image url, instagram href]]
    "positive": [ [image url, instagram href], [image url, instagram href]]
  }
.data: object containing an array of photo objects for every placename you've queried in this session.
  {"san francisco": [ object, object, object, object ],
   "seattle": [ object, object, object, object ],
   "boston": [ object, object, object, object ],
  }
.chartdata:
 a little object with two properties.  used for rendering chart.
 {"positive": ["positive",0.6111]
  "x": ["x","2014-12-9"]}


$scope on USER view has these main properties: 

.instaImages: array of tuples.  each tuple contains two copies (?) of instagram href for a specific post.

.chartData contains info for rendering the chart:
  { "negative": ["negative", -1, 0, 0]
    "positive": ["positive", 1, 1, 0]
    "x": ["x","2014-11-1,2014-10-1,2014-9-1"]
  }

.chart - appears to be a d3 or c3 node


ROUTING:


- '/' - serve static assets like index.html
  - this includes serving up our 'top30' 
- '/instagram' - respond to requests for specific cities
  - what city is being searched for?
  - if not memoized - fetch data from Instagram API. memoize it. (can be skipped in version 1.0)
  - serve memoized files from DB to client (can happen simultaneously with last step)


CRON:

every day, at midnight:

- empty out the database
- run a query for each of the top cities.
  - get 30 pages of results.
  - (20 msgs each = 600 points per city)
  - 600*30 = 18000 msgs total
  - compress that data and store it in the server



DAY 3 to-do:

make sure database CRUD commands are working
connect to instagram API
connect to instagram API without OAuth
script to populate DB with top 30 cities
scipt to send top 30 cities to client (special logic on client side or server side?)
set up pagination script (to get much larger sets of results)
fix the 404-sending utility.  it crashes
